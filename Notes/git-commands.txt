-- Git Notes --

<--- Regular Workflow --->
  $ git add * [ ]
  $ git commit -m "<msg>" [ can also add -a to only commit existing files that we changed/removed, but not newly created files ]
  $ git push


<--- Branching --->
  $ git branch [ Displays all local branches ]
  $ git branch -r [ Displays all remote branches ]
  $ git branch <branch_name> [ Creates a new branch with specified name ]
  $ git checkout <branch_name> [ Switched to branch <branch_name>]
  $ git --set-upstream origin <branch_name> [ Sets the upstream remote branch to the origin {lol}]

<--- Deleting Branches --->
  $ git branch -d <branch_name> [ Deletes local branch of specified name ]
  $ git push origin --delete <branch_name> [ Deletes remote branch of specified name ]


<--- Merging --->
  $ git checkout <branch_to_merge_to> [ Double check and make sure to run this before you merge! ]
  $ git merge <branch_to_merge_in> [ Provided that you don't have uncomitted changes, should merge them together ]


<--- Undoing changes --->
$ git checkout -- . [ Rewinds to the most recent commit ]
$ git reset [ Wipes the any `git add .` made if you're yet to commit them ]
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1 [ Wipes the previous commit ]


<--- Misc Commands --->
  $ git fetch [ Essentially a refresh, updates your local environment with any changes made in remote without pulling anything ]
  $ git diff [ Shows all changes in the working tree not yet staged for the next commit. Use --cached to see difference between staged changes and last commit ]
  $ git log [ Shows list of previous commits for current branch ]
  $ git reflog [ Shows a history of all git commands (commits, branch changes etc.) and their refrences ]


<--- Useful Analogies/Tips --->

upsteam -> upload | downstream -> download

origin/<branch_name> specifies a remote branch
