Sudo Password: The usual :D



-- Useful Hints --

- Use ><file> to write output from stdout to file { NB: use >><file> to append }and <<file> to get stdin from file

- Can press tab to autocomplete any command line statement

- Specify the -r flag for cp, rm, grep to recursively act on many files in one command 

- Levels of Help: whatis -> --help -> man

- Use | to establish a pipe between multiple commands. The output for the first becomes the input for the next

- Add & after a command to execute it in background

- Location of Root: C:\Users\Jiles Denham\AppData\Local\Packages\Canonical*\LocalState\rootfs

- Arithmetic: Variable assignment can be done on the command line, e.g. $ <var>=<int>. Then use $ echo $[$<var1> + $<var2>] to conduct arithmetic

$ touch <filename> [make a new file called filename]

$ history [ To show a list of every command ever used ]

$ find <path> -name <file_name> [ Search for a file in a given path. Can also specift file type ]

$ grep [--flags] <pattern> path [ -r for all files, -n to show line.  Can alternaitvely use rgrep instead of specifying -r ]

$ chmod <bitcode> <file_name> [ Modifies permissions of a file according to the bitcode, 755 for full access for file owner ]

$ cat <file1> >> <file2> [ Writes entirely of <file1> to end of <file2> ] 


-- SSH & Server Commands --

$ ssh <username>@<host_ip> -i <private_key_path> [ Initiates a remote terminal session with the specified server. Login as root if first time ]

-- GDB Notes --
