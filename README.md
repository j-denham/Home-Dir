# Home Directory

My scripts here will work out the box if ~/Notes and ~/Scipts exist. Lay out
yours how you want, you'll just have to change a bunch of stuff

Also, see the code for each script before you start using them. They need a few things as prereqs to get them up and running

### Aliases to define

* `alias pomodoro="~/Scripts/pomodoro.sh"`
* `alias adultpls="~/Scripts/adultpls.sh"`
* Also put in `~/Scripts/welcome.sh` at the top of your .bashrc
